`CommandClick`'s `fannel` repository

`fannel` is `ComamndClick` using script (javascript, and shellscript)  
For instance, your click script in `CommandClick`. One thing I can say that `CommandClick` is developed for the purpose of changing javaxcript and shellscript to gui appication. That applies to click script. It`s so called Gui application. We can say so. I call the gui application `fannel`.
